I was fortunate to receive [funding](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9976989&icde=53097928&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=) from the NIH for the type 1 diabetes work. The work focuses on data generated from the [TEDDY](https://teddy.epi.usf.edu/) consortium, of which my PhD mentor, Dr. Jin-Xiong She, is a PI.

A manuscript detailing the polygenic risk of islet autoimmunity in newborns is in preparation.
