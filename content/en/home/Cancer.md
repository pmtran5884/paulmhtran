I am involved in several cancer projects. I formulated the project and conducted all of the brain cancer project. For the gynecologic cancer projects, I was involved in patient consent, specimen collection, sample processing, data curation, and data analysis.

## Brain Cancer
I used publicly available glioma transcriptomic data and applied a custom unsupervised classification algorithm using a combination of [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [density-based clustering](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.121.9220). I identified four clusters highly similar to previously published IDH-codel groups and methylomic groups. The new clusters may better reflect patient survival compared to previously reported glioma groups.

I have submitted a second publication which uses a local retrospective cohort to validate our findings in our original publication.
