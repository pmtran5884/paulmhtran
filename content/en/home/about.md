My name is Paul Minh Huy Tran. I am a second generation Vietnamese American. I am an 8th year MD/PhD student at [Augusta](https://jagwire.augusta.edu/in-their-own-words-paul-tran/) [University](https://jagwire.augusta.edu/tag/paul-tran/).

I completed my PhD dissertation titled ["APPLICATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING TO GENOMICS:
STUDIES IN TYPE 1 DIABETES AND CANCER"](https://www.augusta.edu/gradschool/documents/paul-tran-defense-announcement.pdf) in Spring 2020 from the lab of [Jin-Xiong She, PhD](https://augusta.pure.elsevier.com/en/persons/jin-xiong-she). 

I live with my mother, sister, sister's dog ("Nhan"), and my kitten ("Luna").

My partner and I take care of three fur babies. They are Luna, a 5 month old kitten; George, a chonky boy; and Elliot, our old man.
