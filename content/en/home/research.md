### Undergraduate Research (2012-2014)
I worked on two microbiology research during my undergraduate training at the University of North Georgia, Dahlonega Campus. 

##### 1) Antibiotic Resistance mechanisms of the gut microbe Bacteroides spp. (2012-2014) 
I studied a putative tripartite efflux pump with high homology to the well studied E. coli AcrE-AcrF-TolC pump by using perform genetic complementation and drug susceptibility assays. This work was performed under the mentorship of Paul Johnson, PhD. [Abstract](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wYKErS21Zy41gvfiAymo-kUuG8xv0kEG/view?usp=sharing)

##### 2) Abundance and Diversity of Halophiles on the salt pans of Sapelo Island (2013)
Two of my classmates and I traveled to Sapelo Island, GA to explore the halophiles on the salt pans of sapelo island. We found that higher salinity salt pans are usually further away from freshwater and that the higher salinity salt pans have both high abundance and diversity of halophiles! This work was performed under the co-mentorship of Nancy Dalman, PhD and Paul Johnson, PhD.

Stay tuned for a blog coming about my experience on Sapelo Island!

### Medical School Years 1-2 (2014-2016)
During my first year of medical school, I rotated with three mentors.

##### 1) Post-transcriptional regulation of csrA through the FliW chaperone protein in Campylobacter jejuni (2014)
I rotated in the laboratory of Stuart Thompson, PhD. We studied with role of the chaperone protein FliW in regulating the transcription factor csrA in Campylobacter jejuni.

##### 2) The association of inflammatory markers with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression (2015)
I rotated in the laboratory of Brian Miller MD, PhD, MPH and we performed a literature review of associations between the serum levels of C-reactive protein and three psychiatric disorders

##### 3) Renal Cell Carcinoma (2015)
I rotated in the laboratory of Jin-Xiong She, PhD, who I selected as my PhD mentor. See below for more information of our research work.

##### 4) Case report of a NUT Midline Carcinoma (2015)
I presented a case report on a case of NUT midline carcinoma at the Southeastern Surgical Congress in 2015

### Graduate School: Cancer Projects (2016-2020)
During my early years in graduate school, I applied machine learning methods to genomics data to help with classification and predicting poor prognosis in various cancers.

I formulated the project and conducted all of the brain cancer project. For the gynecologic cancer projects, I was involved in patient consent, specimen collection, sample processing, data curation, data analysis, and manuscript writing.

##### Brain Cancer
This project is a major part of my thesis. I used publicly available glioma transcriptomic data and applied a custom unsupervised classification algorithm using a combination of [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [density-based clustering](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.121.9220). I identified four clusters highly similar to previously published IDH-codel groups and methylomic groups. The new clusters may better reflect patient survival compared to previously reported glioma groups.

I have submitted a second publication which uses a local retrospective cohort to validate our findings from the original publication.

##### Cervical Cancer
I was involved in two major research project in cervical cancer.

1) Cervical cancer Transcriptomic Signature 
In this first project, I worked with John Wallbillich, MD to develop a multi-gene prognostic model for cervical adenocarcinoma using The Cancer Genome Atlas transcriptomic data.

2) Serum markers of Poor Prognosis in a Peruvian Cohort
In this project, I helped analyze data from the Cervicusco project head by Darron Ferris, MD. We wanted to identify serum markers of poor prognosis that could be used in the low resource settings in Peru.

* The first manuscript identifies anti-glycan antibodies using a custom array developed by Sharad Purohit, PhD and my mentor, Jin-Xiong She, PhD. [Manuscript](https://www.gynecologiconcology-online.net/article/S0090-8258(20)30023-8/fulltext)

* The second manuscript identifies serum proteins detected on a muliplex immunoassay associated with poor prognosis.

### Graduate School: T1D Projects (2018-2021)
During my later years in graduate school, I applied machine learning methods to genetic, clinical, and serum protein data to help with predicting islet autoimmunity and diabetic complications.

##### Polygenic Risk Score for Islet Autoimmunity
I was fortunate to receive [funding](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9976989&icde=53097928&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=) from the NIH for the type 1 diabetes work. The work focuses on data generated from the [TEDDY](https://teddy.epi.usf.edu/) consortium, of which my PhD mentor, Dr. Jin-Xiong She, is a PI.

A manuscript detailing the polygenic risk of islet autoimmunity in newborns is in preparation. [News article feature](https://jagwire.augusta.edu/tag/paul-tran/)

Stay tuned for a blog post of the difference between a PRS for islet autoimmunity compared to type 1 diabetes and why it is more important to predict islet autoimmunity.

##### Type 1 Diabetes Complications
This project is part of the Phenome and Genome of Diabetic Autoimmunity (PAGODA) study initiated by my mentor, Jin-Xiong She, PhD through funding from NIDDK and JDRF.

* The first manuscript describes the role of the modifiable risk factors, blood pressure and glucose level, in developing microvascular complications of type 1 diabetes. This manuscript is currently under review.

### Medical School Years 3-4 (2020-2022)
During my last two years of the MD/PhD program, I continued to work on my projects from graduate school and wrote up case reports from interesting cases I saw during my clinical clerkships.
*Impella for COVID19 related cardiomyopathy, abstract submitted (2020)

*Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (2020)
